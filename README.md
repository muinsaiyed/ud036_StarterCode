# Getting Started
This program will allow a user to open a website with a list of my favorite movies. Clicking on any of the movie posters will open a youtube trailer for the movie.

**There are three important files which are a part of this project:**
`entertainment_center.py`  - Lists out all of the movie objects with all of their attributes
`media.py` - The Movie class and constructor to create instances of movies
`fresh_tomatoes.py` - The file which will create and open a website of our list of movies

# Installation/Setup
In order to run the program, open and run the `entertainment_center.py` file.

To open and run the `entertainment_center.py` file, Python must be installed.

After installing Python, right click and open the file in IDLE.

Once the file is open in IDLE click `F5` or select `Run --> Run Module`.

This will open the web browser and will allow the user to click on a movie poster to play the trailer for the movie.
