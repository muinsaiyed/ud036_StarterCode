# Getting Started
This program will allow a user to open a website with a list of my favorite movies. Clicking on any of the movie posters will open a youtube trailer for the movie. 

**There are three important files which are a part of this project:**
`entertainment_center.py`  - Lists out all of the movie objects with all of their attributes
`media.py` - The Movie class and constructor to create instances of movies
`fresh_tomatoes.py` - The file which will create and open a website of our list of movies

# Installation/Setup
In order to run the program, open and run the `entertainment_center.py` file.
